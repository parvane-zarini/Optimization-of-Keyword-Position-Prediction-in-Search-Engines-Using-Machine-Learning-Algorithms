# Optimization-of-Keyword-Position-Prediction-in-Search-Engines-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This project was carried out with the aim of using machine learning algorithms to predict the position of keywords in search engines. In this study, various models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were used to analyze and predict keyword positions.

With the increasing use of the internet and search engines such as Google, optimizing the position of keywords in these search engines has gained significant importance. Selecting and predicting keyword positions helps businesses increase the visibility of their websites in search results and attract more traffic. This project was carried out with the aim of using Machine Learning algorithms to predict the position of keywords in search engines. In this research, various models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were used to analyze and predict keyword positions. The project specifically focuses on data related to organic keywords, and its goal is to improve SEO strategies and increase the conversion rate.

**Literature Review
**
In recent years, numerous studies have been conducted in the field of search engine optimization (SEO) and keyword selection using machine learning algorithms. The primary article of this project, titled “Machine Learning-Based Keyword Selection and Search Engine Optimization,” specifically explores this topic and examines data-driven approaches for improving SEO strategies. The article first presents the limitations of traditional methods of keyword selection. Traditional approaches mainly rely on human experience and trial-and-error, which are considered inefficient due to the increasing complexity of the market and the constant changes in search engine algorithms. In contrast, machine learning can optimize the process of keyword selection by analyzing large amounts of data. The primary article shows that the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning algorithms can help identify user needs more accurately and extract relevant keywords. For example, analyzing user search behavior can lead to identifying long-tail keywords and related synonyms that help improve website rankings in search results.

Data Description

The dataset used in this project includes information related to organic keywords. These data were collected from reliable sources and include the following features:

**Feature	Description
**
Keyword	The keyword searched by users
Position	The position of the keyword in search results
Search Volume	Monthly search volume for each keyword
Keyword Difficulty	Competition difficulty for each keyword
CPC	Cost per click for advertisements
Traffic	The amount of traffic generated by the keyword
Number of Results	The number of search results related to the keyword

Data preprocessing included cleaning the data, normalization, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

**Steps and Algorithms Used
**
Data splitting:
The dataset was divided into two parts at an 80:20 ratio:
• 80% training data for training the models
• 20% test data for evaluating the models

**Algorithms used:
**
a) Linear Regression
The Linear Regression model was used to predict keyword positions based on different features such as search volume, CPC, and the number of search results.

b) Decision Tree Classifier
This model was used for classifying the data and predicting keyword positions. The algorithm splits the data into different branches and makes the final decision based on specific rules.

c) Random Forest Regressor
The Random Forest model is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to provide more accurate predictions. This model showed the best performance in predicting keyword positions.

**Results**

Model performance comparison:
Model	Prediction Score
Linear Regression	0.0071
Decision Tree Classifier	0.0632
Random Forest Regressor	0.3104

The Random Forest Regressor model demonstrated the best performance and was able to predict keyword positions more accurately.

**Visual analysis of results:
**To visually represent the results, charts were plotted showing keyword positions and related features. These charts indicated that keywords with high search volume and low competition can achieve better positions in search results. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between click-through rate (CTR) and keyword position.

**Suggestions for improving SEO:
**
-Focus on long-tail keywords to reduce competition.
-Optimize website content based on user behavior.
-Use machine learning models to analyze competitor data and improve SEO strategies.
